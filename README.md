## Bonus

-1 is a default value. If all values are left as default then the entire bonus level will give default rewards. If even 1 reward is changed, everything else will give nothing.

# Warnings

This tool allows the replacement of almost anything with almost anything else. The game however does not usually enjoy doing such. Here are some warnings for each section.

### Chests

Function normally and can contain almost anything.

### Popups

Does not particularly enjoy holding abilities.

Replace with abilities at your own risk!

### Bonuses

While bonuses can be replaced with HP+, MP+, armor slot+, accessory slot+, item slot+, drive slot+, or rewards. Only 2 of the above will popup when finishing the fight and while sometimes all rewards can be recieved, the game also enjoys crashing when there are more than 2 things appearing. Absolutely use caution with replacement.

### Forms

Function normally and can contain almost anything.

# TODO

Equipment is almost implemented. Keyblades function correctly but turned off while other equipment is still on the way.

Add level up location
